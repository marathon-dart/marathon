# Marathon Sessions

This is a module of the Marathon framework, an initiative to bolster server-side development in Dart by providing
common utilities on top of [shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf).

This module provides robust, secure session management with support for interfacing with external "session stores".
It's modeled off of [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session), a session management utility for
JavaScript.

A specification for this module is available on the docs.
