A framework and collection of packages for writing http servers, built on top of the shelf package.

This framework is intended to reduce the technical debt associated with server-side Dart
by relying on existing utilities where possible, and filling in the gaps with original code
and syntactic sugar where necessary.

This repository is a monorepo. The Marathon "framework" is a collection of modules on top of the shelf
library. Each of these modules has its own subfolder in the `packages` folder. See the docs if you are
unsure about how to get started.

## Specification
