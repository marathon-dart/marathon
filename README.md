A framework and collection of packages for writing http servers, built on top of the shelf package.

This framework is intended to reduce the technical debt associated with server-side Dart
by relying on existing utilities where possible, and filling in the gaps with original code
and syntactic sugar where necessary.

This repository is a stub right now, as the project is still in the planning phase. We plan
to ship a preliminary alpha by the end of May, though this timeline is subject to change.

## Specification

A (WIP) spec is available at: https://marathon-1.gitbook.io/marathon/
